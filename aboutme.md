<figcaption>Me in 2018</figcaption>

I am a modeling researcher and project manager at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism [[START]](https://www.start.umd.edu) at the University of Maryland, College Park (UMD) <a href="https://umd.edu/"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tyleraclark/tyleraclark.github.io/main/_images/umd.png" width="20" height="20" /></a>. My reasearch focus on the application of statistical, computational, and mathematical methodologies to analyze and model the behavior of violent non-state actors, including natural language processing, machine learning, and stochastic processes.

I received my B.A. in Mathematics and Physics, both with distinction, from Connecticut College<a href="https://conncoll.edu/"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tyleraclark/tyleraclark.github.io/main/_images/CC.svg" width="20" height="20" /></a> in 2019.
