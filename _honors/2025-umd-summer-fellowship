Summer Research Fellowships provide support to doctoral students in the period shortly before or after advancement to candidacy. The Fellowship enables doctoral students to devote a summer of focused work to prepare for or complete a benchmark in their program. The goal is to help doctoral students to take a significant step forward in their studies in order to reduce time-to-degree, increase degree completion, and enhance the graduate student experience.
