The Graduate School's Dean's Fellowships are offered by graduate programs in order to create greater flexibility in creating overall support packages for students. Graduate School Dean's Fellowships may be used as recruitment tools for prospective students or as awards for currently enrolled students. Each year, the Graduate School allocates a certain number of Deanâ€™s Fellowships to colleges who then allocate the fellowships to programs.  Programs are then responsible for recruiting and retaining outstanding students.
