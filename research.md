### Divergent Dimensions of Radicalization Risk: Migration and Violent Extremism in Sabah

September 2020 - December 2021

**Description**: 

>State Department polling indicates that public support for the Islamic State (IS) is on the rise in Malaysia. Moreover, the Malaysian police claim to have thwarted dozens of terrorist attacks since 2013. Importantly, Malaysia has served as a transit hub and training ground for terrorists, and approximately one hundred Malaysians, including women and children, have traveled to Iraq and Syria to support the creation of IS. Though only a handful have returned, radicalization and recruitment to violence remain a risk in Malaysia, as evidenced by more than 430 terror-related arrests since 2013.
>
>There are undoubtedly opportunities to mitigate these risks in Malaysia by addressing the dynamics of radicalization and mobilization to violence. This, however, requires nuanced understanding of the threat, and extant research capacity on terrorism and violent extremism in Malaysia is unfortunately limited. This is especially the case outside of Kuala Lumpur.
>
>This project will begin to fill this gap. The proposed work will be conducted at the Universiti Malaysia Sabah (UMS), and will focus on Sabah, where radicalization risks are especially high. This is the case as Sabah has the highest rates of undocumented migration in Malaysia. Sabah’s close proximity to the Philippines, combined with longstanding trade routes and close, cross-border familial ties between the two countries facilitate migrant flows. While the vast majority of emigrants are motivated by economic opportunity, extensive evidence suggests that Filipino violent extremist organizations (VEOs) are also exploiting these flows. Sabah is not merely a transit point for Filipino VEOs; rather some groups are actively engaged in radicalizing and recruiting Malaysians and Filipino expats living in Sabah.

**Methods**

The project team trained local researchers to conduct sensitive interviews based on best practices for both focus group and key informant interviews in conflict zones.

### The Road Less Traveled: Bolstering the Absorptive Capacity of Southern Central American States to Facilitate the Southern Flow of Northern Triangle Immigrants

Septmeber 2020 - February 2021

**Description**

>The project aims to expand on existing work on the niches of Northern Triangle immigrants living in Mexico to Costa Rica and Panama. It will do so through a data-driven analysis of a) the relationship between levels of violence, employment opportunities, and the number of Honduran, Salvadoran, and Guatemalan immigrants in Mexico, and b) the extent to which Northern Triangle migrants choose to settle in alternative locations, specifically Panama and Costa Rica. Findings in support of the hypothesis will result in a series of recommendation regarding what the U.S. Government (USG) could be doing to aid Panama and Costa Rica’s absorption of Northern Triangle migrants. If the findings suggest that Northern Triangle migrants choose not to settle in alternative locations, this project will further analyze the reasons that factor into that decision. Furthermore, it will consider what specific policies/investments the USG could undertake to encourage migration to those nations.
>
>The primary goal of the project will be to identify at what rate Northern Triangle migrants choose to emigrate south as opposed to north. The countries that make up the Northern Triangle have systemic issues that affect the livelihoods of the citizens of those countries. Costa Rica and Panama have more developed economies and more stability than the Northern Triangle countries, which lack the stable agricultural and manufacturing industries and substantial international investment that are present in Costa Rica and Panama. This project will use demographic data collected by the target countries, field interviews, a review of the extant literature, and econometric modeling to determine if Costa Rica and Panama (or elsewhere) could serve as alternative destinations for Northern Triangle refugees and migrants. A secondary goal of the research will be to determine if economic investment in Costa Rica, and/or Panama as alternative destinations could affect the flow of migrants/refugees from Northern Triangle countries as the present situation is not sustainable and the United States cannot absorb the additional labor force. The results will intend to improve the decision-making capacity of the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Government, and U.S. business interests to work with the governments and industries of Costa Rica and Panama to absorb a proportion of Northern Triangle refugees/migrants.

**Methods**

This project utilizes two main methodologies. First, as part of desk study that aims to understand migration dynamics of Northern Triangle migrants as well as Panama and Costa Rica’s capabilities and ongoing efforts, it will collect empirical evidence about the scope and density of Northern Triangle migrants in these countries. Researchers will exclusively use publically available immigration, employment, and public opinion statistics and data from Panama, Costa Rica, as well as Northern Triangle countries. The data then will be modeled using a nested model of analysis, beginning with descriptive statistics and building up to comparative and bivariate analyses. This portion of the project will allow us to better understand the scale of Northern Triangle out-migration throughout the region as well as the economic and social push/pull factors. Second, the project will utilize qualitative data collection by way of key informants that are professionals working in governmental and non-governmental migration organizations as well as focus groups with migrant populations in parts of Costa Rica and Panama with a high migrant density.

### Datasets for Modeling and Mitigating Insider Risk (D-MInR)

May 2021 - September 2021

**Description**

> Identify extant datasets that may be useful for future Insider Risk efforts for the US government (USG) and its allies and partners, and to characterize those datasets in terms of their location, relevance, accessibility, portability, reproducibility, and other key parameters. If successful, the primary deliverable would be a dataset catalog to help Insider Risk researchers best design research strategies to leverage these datasets to conduct exploratory research (i.e., develop new hypotheses, discover new patterns, build new models or tools) and/or confirmatory research (i.e., test and validate existing hypotheses, tools, and models).

**Methods**

Literature review, targeted search

**Responsibilities**

- Utilized domain expertise to identify relevant datasets, academic publications and data sources
- Queried for and collected relevant datasets through Kaggle, Github, DataMart, and other online repositories of data
- Reviewed researcher entries on datasets for accuracy and relevance

### The Arctic All-Hazards GIS Platform

September 2020 - January 2021

**Description**

>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Arctic Environmental Response Management Application (ERMA) serves an important function for improving U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Arctic domain awareness. However, increased activity in the Arctic (particularly the U.S. Arctic Extended Economic Zone, or EEZ) demonstrates the need for an all-hazards approach centered on a next-generation geospatial platform capable of displaying, informing, and disseminating data to users from various communities (e.g., the public, non-governmental, state, local, tribal, and federal). This project seeks to provide a web application that matches the state-of-the-art in commercial geovisualization. The project team will work with stakeholders to design, develop, and implement a web-based geospatial tool in an ArcGIS Online format. The research goal is to minimize redundancy by providing an accessible application that meets stakeholder needs. The project team will test presently available options (e.g., ERMA) for user experience, interface, and design. Through creating Alpha and Beta versions, and testing with project stakeholders, the research team will discover areas of needed improvement in coding, display, and usability. The project will result in an Arctic web GIS application and that is driven by HQ and operational level USCG mission needs and requirements. This project blends basic research into cartographic design with the applied research of implementing a webGIS application that uses state-of-the-art technologies and methods and will be compliant with the DHS S&T prototype Integrated Maritime Domain Enterprise (IMDE). The application will be built within the Geospatial Information Infrastructure (GII) under the Geospatial Management Office (GMO) and the Homeland Security Information Network (HSIN) infrastructure and that it will align with existing requirements within HSIN and the GMO. A HSIN Community of Interest will be overseen by the project champion.

**Responsibilities**

- Designing user guide to teach stakeholders how to use the tool
- Incorporating feedback from stakeholders into updates for user guide
