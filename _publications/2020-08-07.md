To further the research agenda on chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) attacks, we present a novel methodology for modeling a CBRN terrorist attack cycle as a stochastic process. With this model, we can investigate the following questions: Given an adversaryâ€™s intent to pursue unconventional weapons, what agents do different perpetrator types pursue? What is the likelihood of a CBRN adversary acquiring or deploying a weapon? At what stage is an adversary most likely to abort their planned attack or be interdicted by law enforcement? Our model successfully identifies correlations between perpetrator type, weapon type, and outcome.
