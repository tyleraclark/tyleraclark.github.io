### Welcome

I am a researcher at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism [[START]](https://www.start.umd.edu). I focus on the application of statistical, computational, and mathematical models to analyze behavior of violent non-state actors, including natural language processing, machine learning, and stochastic processes. I have experience researching and managing projects across a variety of domains and funders including including the Department of Homeland Security,[^1] Department of State,[^2] US Coast Guard,[^3] and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency[^4].

I received my B.A. in Mathematics and Physics from Connecticut College in 2019.
