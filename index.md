## Welcome to my Website

My name is Tyler A. Clark. I am a researcher at the [National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism](https://www.start.umd.edu)

### About Me

My research focuses on the application of statistical, computational, and mathematical models to analyze behavior of violent non-state actors, including natural language processing, machine learning, and stochastic processes. I have experience researching and managing projects across a variety of domains and funders including including the Department of Homeland Security, Department of State, US Coast Guard, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.

I received my B.A. in Mathematics and Physics from Connecticut College in 2019.
